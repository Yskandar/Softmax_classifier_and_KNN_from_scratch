# Project Description
In this project, we implement a softmax classifier and a K-nearest-neighbor algorithm from scratch and train them. We do not use any DL library, only classic math libraries are required (numpy, math, mathplotlib...).

# Pathway
To understand how the project was built, follow the notebooks in the following order:
1. knn_nosol.ipynb
2. softmax_nosol.ipynb

All these notebooks call files in the nndl and utils folder.
The requirements for this project are listed in requirements.docx .

# References
These notebooks originate from uncompleted assignements from Pr. Kao's class : Neural Networks and Deep Learning at UCLA. I implemented all the missing parts.
